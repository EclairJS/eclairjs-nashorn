   To send a JavaScript object to a spark worker we need to convert it to a Java object that implements java.io.Serializable.
   JSONSerializer is that object, this object has a string properties that is the JSON representation of the JavaScript object
   to be sent to the workers. Once it arrives at the workers it must be converted back to a JavaScript object (Serialize.JSONSerializer)
   for use in the LAMBDA function.
